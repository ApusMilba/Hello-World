# Personal Information
My name is **Rolf**, I'm from Switzerland.
I did my Bachelor, Master and PhD at ETH ZÃ¼rich in Electrical Engineering.
I was a railway engineer, first on rolling stock, afterwards on signalling and telecommunication. Then I was a professor at a university of applied sciences and leader of the Institute **Power and Signal Processing**. Finally I founded my own company [**eduRail**](https://www.edurail.com/) (it still exists, but I'm no longer in). Now I'm retired.
Last year I made my CS50 certificate in **Introduction to Computer Science** at the Harvard University (David J. Malan). Final project see [here](https://youtu.be/Cd2WimU_G_g).
