My name is **Rolf**, I'm from Switzerland.
I did my Bachelor, Master and PhD at ETH ZÃ¼rich in Electrical Engineering.
I was a railway engineer, first on rolling stock, afterwards on signalling and telecommunication. Then I was a professor at an university of applied sciences and leader of the institute **Power and Signal Processing**. Finally I had an own company **eduRail**.
Now I'm retired.
